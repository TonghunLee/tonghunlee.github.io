Welcome to my website! I am a second-year PhD student in the department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at the Univeristy of California, Berkeley. Before joining Berkeley, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago. Prior to that, I earned a B.S. degree in Information and Industrial Engineering from Yonsei University.



This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

Research interests
======
My research interest lies in operationalizing decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in how online platforms can enhance market efficiency. With this focus, I aim to develop practical algorithms for real-world applications, ensuring they are both theoretically robust and empirically validated. My goal is to explore how mechanism design can effectively manage inefficiencies arising from service operations.
