Welcome to my website! I am a second-year PhD student in the department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at the Univeristy of California, Berkeley, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/). Before joining Berkeley, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago. Prior to that, I earned a B.S. degree in Information and Industrial Engineering from Yonsei University.

Research interests
======
My research focuses on how strategic behavior shapes decision-making processes, particularly in online platforms and marketplaces. I aim to study how participantsâ€™ incentives and interactions influence market outcomes, and how mechanism design can align individual strategies with efficient system-wide objectives. By combining applied modeling with theoretical analysis of service operations, my goal is to develop mechanisms and algorithms that are both strategically robust and practically relevant.
