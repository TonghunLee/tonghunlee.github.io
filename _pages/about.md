Welcome to my website! I am a second-year PhD student in the department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at the Univeristy of California, Berkeley. Before joining Berkeley, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago. Prior to that, I earned a B.S. degree in Information and Industrial Engineering from Yonsei University.

Research interests
======
My research interest lies in operationalizing decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in how online platforms can enhance market efficiency. With this focus, I aim to develop practical algorithms for real-world applications, ensuring they are both theoretically robust and empirically validated. My goal is to explore how mechanism design can effectively manage inefficiencies arising from service operations.
